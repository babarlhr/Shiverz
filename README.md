Modula.js
=========

DISCLAIMER:
What is stated below is the goal of the project, most of it is still very WIP, but what's not is already
quite useful


Modula is a suite of JavaScript modules that will help you to build graphical web applications,
by providing you the following functionalities :

- Vector Math
- Matrix Math
- Boundaries
  * Rectangle
  * Circles
  * Ellipses
- Scene Graph
- Color Management
- RayTracing
- Grids, KD-Trees, Bounding Hierarchies,
- Scene and Entity Manager (Game Engine)

Modular
-------
Each graphical application usually has specifics needs that no framework can properly fit.
The goal of Modula is to provide you the pieces that can fit in your design, so that you don't have
to start from scratch.  

Modula gives you several independant modules that can extend other modules to provide what
you need, but no more. If you choose to only pick Boundaries and Vector Math you will not have to
deal with the complexity of Bounding Hierarchies and Matrix Math. But if you do pick those, you will
still get a fully integrated experience.  

Web and JavaScript
------------------
Modula's api is designed around simplicity and the usage of common patterns found 
in modern JavaScript frameworks. It is designed to easily integrate with the latest Web APIs (think Canvas) and
popular Frameworks. 

Documentation
-------------
Modula aims to have have an excellent and honest documentation so that you don't get bad surprises
along the way.
